            <h1>At a Glance</h1>    

            <p>
               I am a PhD candidate in high energy particle physics at Princeton University. My interests include collider phenomenology, dark matter and the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. My current research involves understanding scattering amplitudes from an <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_shell_and_off_shell" target = "_blank"> on-shell </a> perspective. In the past, I have worked on collider and astro-particle phenomenology and also engaged in experimental searches for dark matter at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

               As a kid, I was always curious about my physical surroundings. Being a physicists allows me to continue being a kid, but also get paid for it, at least for the time being. Moreover, I enjoy learning new skills and perspectives. In the last 4 years, the problems I faced daily have pushed me to learn a myriad of new tools in mathematics and computer science that have made me a better physicists and allowed me to communicate effectively with other fields.

            <p>
               After winning the highest academic award in Trinidad and Tobago, the President's Gold Medal, I moved on to MIT and graduated with a double major in Physics and Mathematics, and a minor in Philosophy. At Princeton, I was awarded with Princeton's Presidential Fellowship along with a GEM Associate Fellowship and I will spend the next few years there as a graduate researcher.
