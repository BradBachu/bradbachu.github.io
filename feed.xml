        <p>Princeton physics, Observational Cosmology, Teaching.</p>

      <p>__</p>

      <p>A conversation with Professor Lyman Page, currently the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Physics at Princeton University. </p>

      <p> We talk about his fascination with physics as an undergrad and his unique path to academia, which included a period sailing and self-study after his undergraduate studies. This adventure led him to MIT, where he began working for free before officially joining their graduate program to research experimental cosmology. Page's story continues with his move to Princeton, where he not only advanced his research but also served as department head. Throughout the conversation, he reflects on his teaching approach, the challenge of fostering diversity in physics, and potential strategies to address it. This episode offers a glimpse into the life of a physicist who combines passion for discovery with a commitment to education and inclusivity.</p>
