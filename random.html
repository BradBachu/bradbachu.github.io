               <p> These have had the most impact in my life and I wish I read them before undergrad.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li> Deep Work (Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World), by Cal Newport  </li>
                  <li> The Happiness Advantage: How a Positive Brain Fuels Success in Work and Life, by Shawn Achor  </li>

                  Note that I have not read 'Why We Sleep (Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams), by Matthew Walker', but I have listened to many talks by Matthew Walker. He claims there are some errors in his first book so I am waiting for the 2nd edition.

               <h1>Minimal Shoes</h1>
               <p> Some experts suggest we need to re-evaluate what we put on our feet. Generally speaking, this is the `barefoot/minimal shoes' movement.  Irene Davis and Daniel Lieberman (both at Harvard) have a lot of interesting things to say about this. If you are interested this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_rDFa6kZfI">10min video</a> captures some of the ideas, although it was made by a shoe company. If you are still interested, more scientific information is provided in this <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/irenedavis/ " target="_blank"> podcast</a> or <a href="https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2014.5521">clinical commentary</a>. I currently use shoes from these companies </p>
