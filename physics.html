         <h2> For General Audience</h2>
         <p>
            Generally, I study the interactions and properties of fundamental particles at energy scales attained, for example, at particle colliders (such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN), or near the Big Bang. Physics in this enviroment requires a combination of quantum mechanics (as the length scales are smaller than the size of a proton) and special relativity (as the particles are moving close to, or at, the speed of light). 
         </p>

         <p>
            For those still interested, the main focus of my work is to compute and explore 'scattering amplitudes'. These are essentially the most basic features of reality that can be calculated. They encode the probability that a set of particles will turn into another set of particles upon colliding. These mathematical objects have very interesting properties that allow us to describe, make predictions, and even constrain the universe we live in.

               <h1>On-Shell Massive Scattering Amplitudes</h1>
               <p>
                  I am using the recently introduced 'spin-spinors' and on-shell techniques to
                  explore the properties of massive relativistic scattering amplitudes. The underlying theme being 'how far can we go, and what can we learn, without resorting to a Lagrangian descripion quantum field theory'. This includes topics such as Higgsing, Supersymmetry and Supergravity.

               <h1>Short Distance Top Quark Mass</h1>
               <p>
                  The top quark is the heaviest known fundamendal particle. The current status of its measured mass places systematic uncertainties higher than its statistical uncertainties. Using a combination of 'effective field theories', we show how certain measurement techniques at e+e- colliders can reduce the systematic uncertainties.
